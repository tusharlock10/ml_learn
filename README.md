This is a repo for managing all of my ML learning projects in an organized fashion.

All the projects will have  -
1. The dataset
2. A notebook/ script
3. readme explaining the dataset and the problem

The notebook/ script will also have (or atleast try to have) comments explaining all the steps and functions used as per my own understanding, which may or may not be correct ;)
