Dataset Link - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope

## What does the dataset?
This is the data captured by a telescope which list downs properties of a particle colliding with the telescope, which generates an image unique to that particle. The particle can be gamma or hadron particle.

The generated image can have these properties - fLength, fWidth, fSize, etc.

## What are we supposed to do?
Generate a model which when given these properties of the particle image, can guess the particle
